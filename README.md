Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link, in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets one to the Philosophy article. (See this [Wikipedia essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) for more information)

The Philosophy Game, written in `Python`, lets you do the clicking programmatically.
